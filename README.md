## 🎯 Dashboard Objectives

This dashboard was designed to achieve the following analytical goals:

- Track overall business performance across **Sales**, **Profit**, **Discount**, and **Quantity**.  
- Compare **regional performance** to identify high- and low-performing areas.  
- Analyze **product sub-category sales** to understand demand distribution.  
- Monitor **discount concentration** across states to detect profitability risks.  
- Visualize **profit trends over time** to identify seasonality and growth patterns.

---

### 🔹 **1. Sales & Profit Overview**

### 🔹 **4. Discount Distribution**

- Tailor product offerings to match regional demand patterns.

### ⭐ Product Portfolio Optimization

- Reassess underperformers (Binders, Tables) — explore **bundling** or **discontinuation**.

### ⭐ Forecasting & Planning
